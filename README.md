#Futuregame#

This is for when I can integrate user input via JavaScript with my HTML and CSS skills - basically it's going to be a little game where you pick up inventory, and discard or lose it based on what checkpoints you hit. (Like, kind of Oregon Trail vibes basically.) Oh, and you play as a bird. It's bird inventory.
