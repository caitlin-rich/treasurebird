1. figure out how to make the inventory list an actual list
(like i could hard code it but that's not elegant or efficient.)
2. add more inventory
3. add the rest of the directions
4. placeholder text for the can't add more items text? 
5. disable inventory button if at the end of the directions list
6. update readme
7. trade functionality??

8. this needs a storyline, right? i should write one out, even if it's basic. like why are we competing against the birds for treasure yanno
